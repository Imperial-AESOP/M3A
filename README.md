M3A: Marked MAP Matching Algorithms
===

Marked Markovian Arrival Processes (MMAPs) are a class of stochastic processes
used to model multi-class correlated arrivals at a queuing system.
M3A is a set of Matlab functions designed for computing the statistical descriptors
of MMAPs and fitting marked traces with MMAPs. The documentation is available
<a href="https://github.com/Imperial-AESOP/M3A/blob/master/m3a.pdf">here</a>.

M3A is a joint work of
